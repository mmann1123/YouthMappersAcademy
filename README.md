# YouthMappersAcademy

The [YouthMappers Academy](https://mmann1123.github.io/YouthMappersAcademy/) is an online learning platform designed to equip students, educators, and volunteers with the foundational and advanced skills needed to thrive in the open mapping ecosystem. Whether you’re just beginning your journey with OpenStreetMap (OSM) or seeking to deepen your expertise, our curated modules support learning at every level.

Originally developed to support members of the global YouthMappers network, the Academy now serves a broader audience across the open mapping community. The content spans essential topics—from understanding the OSM ecosystem and using tools like iD Editor and JOSM, to exploring data management, field survey design, and gender considerations in mapping.

The Academy offers two learning tracks:

- **Introductory Track** Explore the basics of OpenStreetMap, tools like the iD Editor, the data model, imagery interpretation, and how to engage in collaborative mapping through platforms like the Tasking Manager.

- **Advanced Track** Deepen your knowledge with advanced JOSM techniques, validation workflows, data export methods, field project planning, and even 3D mapping concepts.

These self-paced modules are designed not only to build practical skills but also to inspire critical thinking and community engagement around open geospatial data. Whether you’re contributing to humanitarian efforts, supporting research, or strengthening your local mapping chapter, the YouthMappers Academy is your gateway to impactful learning and meaningful action.

# Data Management

Welcome to Course 9 of the Youthmappers Academy. 

## Overview 
Most of our early interactions with OSM involve contributing directly to the map, either through remote mapping campaigns or providing edits for areas that are familiar to us.  In instances where we wish to conduct geospatial analysis, or, where we want to produce more refined cartographic products, we will need to extract more nuanced, specific data layers from OSM. In this course, we will learn how to filter and extract data from OSM for our own research purposes. We will also look at various tools that will help us to assess data quality and coverage. 

**In this course, you will:**
- Learn how to filter and extract OSM data for your own research purposes using several different tools
- Learn how to assess the quality of OSM data for a given geographic extent or project using a variety of tools and platforms beyond the JOSM Validator
- sExplore new platforms to share and download supplemental data for your research project

# YouthMappers Academy

Welcome to the YouthMappers Academy!

The YouthMappers Academy is an online learning platform for members of the YouthMappers consortium with associated certification through the American Geographical Societies Geo-Badges program. Geobadges is a micro-credentialing program to acknowledge participants' proficiency in skills and knowledge related to geographic knowledge, and mapping activities.  

The opportunity to earn credentials for spatial theory, software proficiency, and other organizational skills related to YouthMappers activities will enhance your job marketability by providing formal recognition of proficiency and achievement. It is also our hope that the material covered in these modules will incentivize member participation, stimulate thinking and research around open mapping and lead to higher quality mapping outputs.

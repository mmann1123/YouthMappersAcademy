# Module 1: The OSM Ecosystem

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the YouthMappers Academy. In this module, you will learn about the origins of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, its infrastructure, the community, and what keeps us mapping. If you don’t already have one, you will learn how to create an OpenStreetMap account.

### What you will learn:
- What drove the development of OpenStreetMap
- The composition of the OSM community
- The establishment of YouthMappers
- The Code of Conduct for community members
- Ethical considerations when mapping in OpenStreetMap


## What is OpenStreetMap?

OpenStreetMap is a free, open, editable map of the world built by a global community of collaborators. OSM can be accessed at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org), contributed to by over six million volunteers. Data is gathered using field-based and desktop mapping techniques, such as manual surveys, GPS devices, and tracing aerial imagery.

### History of OpenStreetMap
Steve Coast created OpenStreetMap in 2004 in response to restricted access to high-quality map data. Inspired by Wikipedia, he launched OSM as a community-based project. The first collaborative mapping event occurred in London, 2005. Today, OSM benefits from global partnerships, including Maxar, ESRI, and Mapbox.

### What is Open Source Technology?
Open source refers to designs that are publicly accessible, enabling modification and sharing. OSM operates on these principles, fostering collaboration, transparency, and community development.

## The OpenStreetMap Infrastructure

### Infrastructure
OSM allows users to capture information about features in the physical landscape using points, lines, or shapes, accompanied by descriptive tags. Data is collected via manual surveys, GPS, and aerial imagery.

### Accuracy of OSM Data
OSM employs a wiki-style creation process, where contributions can be verified and corrected by the community. This collaborative approach improves map quality and accuracy over time.

## OSM Community

### Community Roles
- **Contributors:** Volunteers adding or updating map data.
- **Data Consumers:** Using OSM for transportation, health care, and more.
- **Developers:** Creating tools for data editing and management.
- **Local Communities:** Organizing regional mapping events.
- **Humanitarian Groups:** Supporting disaster response and development projects.

### YouthMappers
[YouthMappers](www.youthmappers.org) is a global community of researchers, educators, and scholars that creates and uses open geographic data (primarily using OpenStreetMap) to address locally defined development challenges worldwide. Founded in 2014, and formally launched in 2015, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) generously supports this program. Founding partners are Texas Tech University, The George Washington University, and West Virginia University. Arizona State University joined the administration consortium in 2019, and is now the lead fiscal and administrative partner, in collaboration with TTU, GWU and WVU.

At the heart of YouthMappers is an international network of university based, student-led chapters, who organize, collaborate, and implement mapping activities that respond to actual development needs around the globe. The spatial data that they create, and the research that they conduct is made publicly available through open platforms, such as OpenStreetMap. Chapter affiliation offers these students and their faculty advisors the chance to network with others around the world and exchange information, ideas, and results that lead to a greater understanding of resilience, and how technology can be used to address information challenges. 

Members participate in direct mapping activities on the OpenStreetMap platform, both as individual contributors, or, as part of chapter-led activities, such as “Mapathons”. They can also apply for academic opportunities through our Research and Leadership Fellows programs, and funding for field based mapping work through the Fieldwork Program.

While many minds together created the foundation of YouthMappers, the heart of the students is what leads to the success of this global consortium. We are a movement, a movement of students wanting to leave a mark- with the courage to be change agents and resolve in our response to community needs. The collaboration of faculty, staff, and partner organizations has bolstered an experiential learning environment that leads to action. Students decide how and where they put themselves on the map.

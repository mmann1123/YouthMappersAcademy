# YouthMappers Academy

The Youthmappers Academy is an online learning platform for members of the Youthmappers consortium associated with our own series of YouthMappers badges. Our badges acknowledge participants' proficiency related to OpenStreetMap, core geographic knowledge, and mapping skills.

The opportunity to earn credentials for spatial theory, software proficiency and other organizational skills related to Youthmappers activities will enhance your job marketability by providing formal recognition of proficiency and achievement. It is also our hope that the material covered in these courses will incentivize member participation, stimulate thinking and research around open mapping and lead to higher quality mapping outputs.

# Module 13: Introduction to 3D Data

## Overview

Welcome to Module 13 of the YouthMappers Academy. This module explores three-dimensional (3D) geospatial data, covering data formats, standards, and a wide range of applications in development. 

You will learn how 3D data is collected through technologies like LiDAR, photogrammetry, and ground surveying, and how it can be integrated into OpenStreetMap (OSM) for mapping urban and natural environments. We will also discuss best practices for visualizing 3D data using tools such as Cesium, QGIS, and ArcGIS.

3D geospatial data enhances decision-making, planning, and communication among development stakeholders, with critical applications in urban planning, disaster response, infrastructure management, and sustainability efforts aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

### What you will learn:
- You will learn about three dimensional data formats, models and standards.
- You will explore the primary methods of collecting 3D geospatial data, including LiDAR, photogrammetry, InSAR, and ground surveying.
- You will compare and evaluate different three-dimensional data sources and tools
- You will explore key applications of 3D geospatial data, including urban planning, disaster response, environmental sustainability, and humanitarian mapping.
- You will learn about best practices and tools for three dimensional data visualization.
- You will develop hands-on skills in collecting and integrating simple 3D data in the field using mobile tools like FieldPapers and Vespucci.
- You will learn how three dimensional data can be incorporated into the OSM data model and the best tools and workflows to facilitate this. 


## Introduction to 3D Data

### What is 3D data?
In Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3D data refers to spatial data that includes a third dimension—the Z-coordinate—which represents height, depth, or elevation. Unlike traditional 2D GIS, which maps features on a flat plane, 3D GIS enables more detailed, realistic, and interactive visualizations of geographic space. 

### **Why is 3D Data Important?**
 
3D GIS is widely used across various industries, including:
- Urban Planning – Visualizing city skylines, zoning impacts, and infrastructure projects.
- Disaster Response – Modeling floods, landslides, and evacuation routes.
- Architecture & Construction – Creating accurate 3D models of buildings and infrastructure.
- Environmental Studies – Analyzing terrain, climate change, and natural resource distribution.

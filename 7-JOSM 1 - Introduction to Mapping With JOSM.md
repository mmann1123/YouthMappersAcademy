# Introduction to Mapping with JOSM 
 
## Overview 
Welcome to Course 7 of the Youthmappers Academy. In this module, we will take a look at JOSM, or, the Java OpenStreetMap Editor. JOSM is a desktop editing application for OpenStreetMap, written in Javascript, which provides a whole host of advanced editing 
tools for working with OSM data. JOSM is also the preferred tool for validation in OSM (weâ€™ll talk a little more about validation in the next module). Apart from the advanced editing functionality of JOSM, one of its primary benefits is that it allows you to download and work on OSM data offline, which is incredibly beneficial in low/no bandwidth areas.
